I am a self-taught Linux systems engineer with over 20 years of experience in IT. I started my career in the late 1990s working for a startup internet service provider and from the very beginning I had a passion for using and modifying software to achieve my goals. My experience with development started when I was a teenager teaching myself QBasic on DOS 6, and from that point on I continued to mix development with my roles in operations and engineering.
