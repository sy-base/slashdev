I am a self-taught Linux systems engineer with over 20 years of experience in IT. I started my career in the late 1990s working for a startup internet service provider and from the very beginning I had a passion for using and modifying software to achieve my goals. My experience with development started when I was a teenager teaching myself QBasic on DOS 6, and from that point on I continued to mix development with my roles in operations and engineering.

I strive to lead systems infrastructure design and on-going innovation for a vast number of large scale production implementations. My goals include continuing my real world education of systems architecture and enterprise customer facing infrastructure implementations. In addition, researching new technologies are at heart of my drive to increase efficiency and productivity of the systems I maintain. These technologies include but are not limited to Virtualization, Containerization, Infrastructure as Code, and Automation.

I've publisly published many projects which I maintain on my personal Github:
